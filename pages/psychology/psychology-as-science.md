## Psychology

Psychology is the scientific study of the human mind and behaviors. The knowledge in psychology should be gained by **Scientific Reasoning**, not on personal reasoning, tradition, or common sense. It means that it needs evidence, scientific observation, and scientific experiment.

### Process

2. Data analysis
3. Statistically Significant difference THEN-> scientific research

### Correlation and Causation

Let's assume that video games yield violence. We had observed the relationship between game and violence, and the result above was discovered. We have observed that there is a strong relationship. However, can we say that game cause violence from the graph? The answer is "NO." Correlation is not same as causation. Cause - effect cannot be inferred from the information. We can make three possible scenarios here.

1. Video game could cause violence.
2. Violence could cause video game.
3. Other environment could cause a video game and violence.
