## Memory

![stage_model_of_memory](https://wardballoon.github.io/images/stage_model_of_memory.png)

- Encoding: The information gets into our brains
- Storage: Retaining information in memory over time
- Retrieval: Recalling or using previously encoded and stored information
- Sensory memory: The immediate, very brief recording of sensory information before it is processed into short-term or long-term memory.
- Short-term/working memory: We can hold 7 +/-2 information bits for 20-30 seconds. This is why selective attention occurs (the ability to focus only one stimulus from among all sensory input).
- Long-term memory: Final stages of memory model: Permanent. It is like SAVE button of computer and UNLIMITED CAPACITY but not as accurate as sensory or working memory. There are two types in the Long-term memory.
    - Explicit (Declarative) : Facts or events you can clearly explicitly describe (Vocabulary test. Capital of countries / birthday part last year)
    - Implicit (Non-declarative) : involve things you can’t clearly articulate (skills and actions):How to ride a bicycle.

### Effortful processing strategy

While there is maintenance rehearsal such as just repeating again and again, there is a technique to help the short-term memory store thoughts and ideas and pass them into the long-term memory (Elaborative rehearsal).

- Chunking: organizing data into manageable units. Chunking works even better if we can assemble information into meaningful groups.
- Hierarchies: Complex information broken down into broad concepts and further subdivided into categories.
- Distributed study yields better long-term retention than massed study. We remember better if study or practice is spread over time.
- Testing Effect: Quizzing or testing improves retention than merely re-reading.
- Self-reference effect: The idea that we remember things when we relate material to ourselves.
- Stress Hormones and Memory: Emotions can trigger a rise in stress hormones. These hormones trigger activity in specific area of brain (memory forming activity) and tag memories as important! Excitement, stress, or strong emotion can strengthen memories.
- Primary effect: Tendency for the first items presented to be remembered better or more easily.
- Recency effect: Tendency to remember the last information better (due to highly accessible short term memory).
- Context-Dependent Memory: Memory is more easily recalled if you are in the same setting that learning took place. If you have important test, prepare it in similar place to the real test.
- Context Effects: Ability to recall is improved when in the same context as the initial experience.
- Mood-congruent memory: Remember better when we are in the similar emotional state in which we encoded and stored the information. Ex) It is difficult to remember happy times when depressed.

### Memory-related disorders

- PTSD: Experimental treatments include drugs to block memory
- Flashbulb Memories: Flashbulb memories are clear, detailed memories of emotionally significant events. It's a vivid-seeming memory, but Flashbulb memories are not as accurate as they feel

### Retrieval

- Recall: Memory task in which specific information must be retrieved, as in a fill-in-the blank question on a test.
- Recognition: a form of “multiple choice.” You identify which stimuli match your stored information.
- Retrieval challenge: memory is not stored as a file that can be retrieved by searching alphabetically. Instead, it is stored as a web of associations: conceptual, contextual, and emotional.

### What leads to forgetting?

Encoding failure, Storage decay, and Retrieval failure lead to forgetting. Jill Price not only recalls everything, but is unable to forget anything. “Forgetfulness is a form of freedom.” If we remembered everything, maybe we could not prioritize the important memories.

### Two types of Amnesia

- Retrograde: Inability to access memory before a certain date
- Anterograde: Inability to form or consolidate new memories after a certain date

### False Memory

Our memory can be full of errors! Memory not only gets forgotten, but it gets constructed (imagined, selected, changed, and rebuilt).

- Misinformation Effect: Incorporating misleading information into the memory of an event. If people are asked: “How fast were the cars going when they hit each other?” or “How fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other?” What will happen? The reported recall of the rate of speed depended on how the question was asked.
- source amnesia: forgetting where the story came from, or attributing an event to the wrong source.
