## Stress

Emotions, as well as personality, attitudes, behaviors, and responses to stress, can have an impact on our overall health. Health psychology (studies these impacts, as part of the broader field of behavioral medicine (ex: How stress affects our well-being and health). We now refer to psychophysiological illness, a real illness caused in part by psychological factors such as the experience of stress. Stress reaction refers to emotional and physical responses to the stressor such as rapid heartbeat, elevated cortisol levels, headaches, pressure, crying.

### Stressor 1: Catastrophic Events/Conditions

- Appraisal is not essential in a catastrophic event. Most people agree that the event is harmful and overwhelming.
- Ex: earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, war, and wildfires.
- Short-term effects include increased heart attacks on the day of the event.
- Long term effects include depression, nightmares, anxiety, and flashbacks.
- PTSD

### Stressor 2: Major Life Events/Changes

- Even supposedly “happy” life changes, such as marriage, starting college or a new job, or the birth of a child, can bring increased challenge and stress.
- New roles, new priorities, and new tasks can put a strain on our coping resources.
- The challenge, and the negative impact on health, increases when:
    - The changes are painful, such as a death in family, loss of job, or heart attack.
    - The changes are too many at once.

### Stressor 3: Chronic Daily Difficulties

- Small, day to day irritations, repeated many times.
- Daily difficulties can be caused by facing too many tasks, too little time, and too little control.
- Print jams, traffic, losing keys, Others’ cutting in line

### General Adaptation Syndrome (GAS)

When encountering a sudden trauma or other stressor, our body acts to increase our resistance to threat and harm. There are three stages of adaptation to stress: Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3. Struggling with stress for long periods can drain your physical, emotional, and mental resources to the point where your body no longer has strength to fight stress.

> Phase 1: The Alarm “fight or flight”

When encountering a sudden trauma or other stressor, our body acts to increase our resistance to threat and harm. nervous system responds, increasing the heart rate. Hormones released in response to stress- mobilizing, activating resources.

> Phase 2: Resistance

Body responses with physiological reactions to cope with the stressor- adaptive coping strategies and resisting defeat by the stressor.

> Phase 3: Exhaustion

Body’s resistance to stress is depleted (physical deterioration): burnout, depression, anxiety, weakened immune system.

### Female and Male Stress Response

In response to a stressor such as the death of a loved one, women may
“tend and befriend”: nurture themselves and others, and bond together. Women show behavioral and neurological signs of becoming more empathetic under stress. Men under stress are more likely to socially withdraw and numb themselves. Men are also more likely to become aggressive under stress.

### Placebo effect

A fake treatment can make someone better simply because they expect it to help. The effect of a treatment that results from a patient’s expectations and beliefs rather than the actual medical treatment.

### How you think about stress matters

Kelly Mcgonigal (Health psychologist) said that high stress only increased people’s risk of mortality only when it was combined with belief that stress was bad for health. Mindset influences physical response:

> A: Stress is bad for health and we must avoid and reduce it.

VS

> B: Stress can be useful in high pressure situations to enhance performance.

When you change your mind about stress, you can change your body’s response to stress.
