## Psychological perspective

This is an assumptions (beliefs) about human behavior to observe behaviors from a particular perspective. Psychology uses a variety of perspectives when studying how people think, feel, and behave. There are five main perspectives: Psychodynamic, Behavioral, Cognitive, Biological (Neuroscience), Humanistic.

### Psychodynamic perspective

This perspective argues that thoughts, wishes, feelings, memories (early childhood memories), that are hidden from awareness decide behaviors. Unconsciousness is a powerful influence of human behavior. This is what hypnotherapy based on. It's about healing the unconscious world by lifting ice Berg.

### Behavioral perspective

It is famous for Pavlov's dog. This perspective focuses on behaviors, not mental processes. Behavior is explained by previous **learning**.

### Cognitive perspective

This perspective focuses how people think, take in, process, store, and retrieve information. What we think about our situations affects our behavior rather than situation itself. Behavior is explained by how person interprets the situation.

### Biological (neuroscience) Perspective

This perspective believes that mind is what brain does. Behavior is dictated by Biology such as hormones, brain chemistry, neurotransmitters, genetics, immune system, and nervous system. For example, the reason why love makes you happy is because of dopamine, and the reason why you find stability in old love is because of serotonin.

### Humanistic perspective

This is a perspective that human nature's desire for self-realization determines behavior. Anxiety and depression come because of the difference between ideal self and reality.
