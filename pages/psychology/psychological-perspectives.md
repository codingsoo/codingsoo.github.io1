## Psychological perspective

These are assumptions (beliefs) about human behavior to observe behaviors from a particular perspective. Psychology uses a variety of perspectives when studying how people think, feel, and behave. There are five main perspectives: Psychodynamic, Behavioral, Cognitive, Biological (Neuroscience), Humanistic.

### Psychodynamic perspective

This perspective argues that thoughts, wishes, feelings, and early childhood memories that are hidden from awareness decide behaviors. Unconsciousness has a powerful effect on human behavior. Hypnotherapy is one of the most representative cases of this perspective. It cures the unconscious world by lifting ice Berg.

### Behavioral perspective

It is famous for Pavlov's dog. This perspective focuses on behaviors, not mental processes. Behavior is explained by previous **learning**.

### Cognitive perspective

This perspective focuses how people think, take in, process, store, and retrieve information. What we think about our situations affects our behavior rather than situation itself. Behavior is explained by how person interprets the situation.

### Biological (neuroscience) Perspective

This perspective believes that mind is what brain does. Behavior is dictated by Biology such as hormones, brain chemistry, neurotransmitters, genetics, immune system, and nervous system. For example, the reason why love makes you happy is dopamine, and the reason why you find stability in old love is serotonin.

### Humanistic perspective

This is a perspective that human natural desire for self-realization determines behavior. Anxiety and depression come because of the difference between ideal self and reality.
