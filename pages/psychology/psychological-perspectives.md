# Psychological perspective

These are assumptions (beliefs) about human behavior to observe behaviors from a particular perspective. Psychology uses a variety of perspectives when studying how people think, feel, and behave. There are five main perspectives: Psychodynamic, Behavioral, Cognitive, Biological (Neuroscience), Humanistic.

## Psychodynamic perspective

This perspective argues that thoughts, wishes, feelings, and early childhood memories that are hidden from awareness decide behaviors. Unconsciousness has a powerful effect on human behavior. Hypnotherapy is one of the most representative cases of this perspective. It cures the unconscious world by lifting ice Berg.

### Freud’s Path to Developing Psychoanalysis

Sigmund Freud started his career as a physician. He decided to explore how mental and physical symptoms could be caused by purely psychological factors. He became aware that many powerful mental processes operate in the unconscious, without our awareness. This insight grew into a theory of the human personality and its development. His name for his theory and his therapeutic technique: psychoanalysis. He used creative techniques such as free association: encourage the patient to speak whatever comes to mind. The therapist then interprets any potential unconscious wishes hidden in the client’s hesitations, slips of the tongue, and dreams.

### Freud’s Personality/Mind Iceberg

- Id: We start life with a personality made up of the id, striving impulsively to meet basic needs, living by “the pleasure principle.”
- Ego: In a toddler, an ego develops, a self that has thoughts, judgments, and
memories following a “reality principle”
- Superego: Around age 4 or 5, the child develops the superego, a conscience
internalized from parents and society, following a “morality principle.”

The mind is mostly below the surface of conscious awareness. Personality develops from the efforts of our ego, our rational self, to resolve tension between our id, based in biological drives, and the superego, society’s rules and constraints. The Unconscious, in Freud’s view: A reservoir of thoughts, wishes, feelings, and memories, that are hidden from awareness because they feel unacceptable.

### Freud’s Legacy

- Freud benefitted psychology, giving us ideas about: the impact of childhood on adulthood, defenses, and the tension between our biological selves and our socialized/civilized selves.
- Freud gave us specific concepts we still use often, such as ego, projection, regression, rationalization, and dream interpretation.

## Behavioral perspective

![pavlov's dog](https://wardballoon.github.io/images/pavlov_dog.png)

It is famous for Pavlov's dog. This perspective focuses on behaviors, not mental processes. Behavior is explained by previous **learning**.

## Cognitive perspective

This perspective focuses how people think, take in, process, store, and retrieve information. What we think about our situations affects our behavior rather than situation itself. Behavior is explained by how person interprets the situation.

## Biological (neuroscience) Perspective

This perspective believes that mind is what brain does. Behavior is dictated by Biology such as hormones, brain chemistry, neurotransmitters, genetics, immune system, and nervous system. For example, the reason why love makes you happy is dopamine, and the reason why you find stability in old love is serotonin. So, bio-psychologists think that psychological characteristics such as personality, intelligence and certain behaviors are determined by our genetic inheritance. In fact, some psychological disorders are results of our genes.

### Case Study: Phineas Gage

Phineas Gage was a mild and calm railroad worker. One day, metal rod entered through left part of the head, but survived. Complete personality change occurred after the accident: “Gage was no longer Gage.” He became irritable, uncontrollable, and unpredictable. He was the first case to suggest brain’s role in personality — the ability to suppress impulses and to modulate emotions.

### Neurotransmitter

- Dopamine: Motivation and emotional pleasure (- Parkinson’s disease, + Schizophrenia)
- Serotonin: Mood, sleep and appetite (- depression, anxiety)
- Endorphins: pain relief, elevation of mood
- Acetylcholine: Memory, attention, muscle control (- Alzheimer’s disease)

### Brain’s localization

Localization of brain: different parts of the brain are responsible for specific behaviors. As you can see at the Case Study section, frontal Lobe is related to the personality.

Language is also proved that is related to the brain. There are two areas: Broca’s area and Wernicke’s area. Above picture is the description of this concept.

### Modern day of Measuring brain activity (Brain imaging technique)

- PET Scan: blood flow and chemical activity
- MRI / fMRI: Map of the brain, amount of oxygen, brain activity
- EEG: Electric activity (brain wave)

## Humanistic perspective

This is a perspective that human natural desire for self-realization determines behavior. Anxiety and depression come because of the difference between ideal self and reality.

### Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers

In Maslow’s view, people are motivated to keep moving up a hierarchy of needs, growing beyond getting basic needs met.

- Maslow and Rogers sought to offer a “third force” in psychology: The Humanistic Perspective.
- They studied healthy people rather than people with mental health problems.
- Humanism: focusing on the conditions that support healthy personal growth.
