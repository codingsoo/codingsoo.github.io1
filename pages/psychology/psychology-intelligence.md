## Intelligence

Intelligence is the ability to gather and use information in productive ways. Findings from twin studies indicate that both nature and nurture affect intelligence test scores.

### g factor

Charles Spearman (1863-1945) found g (general intelligence) factor. He believes that generally bright or generally dull depends on the amount of “g.”

### Multiple Intelligences

Gardner (2004) said multiple and independent intelligence. Savant Syndrome supports his theory because people who have Savant Syndrome have mental handicap, but they are brilliant.

### Sternberg’s Intelligence Triarchy

Robert Sternberg proposed that “success” in life is related to three types of ability.

1. Practical intelligence: everyday tasks (“street smarts”)
2. Analytical intelligence: academic problem-solving (intelligence tests)
3. Creative intelligence: reacting to novel situations / generating new ideas

### Emotional Intelligence (EQ)

It involves processing and managing the emotional component of those social situations, including one’s own emotions. Understanding the emotions of others can be considered an aspect of emotional intelligence. There are four components in the emotional intelligence.

- Perceiving emotions: Recognizing emotions in facial expressions, stories, and even in music
- Understanding emotions: Being able to see blended emotions, and to predict emotional states and changes in self and others
- Managing emotions: Modulating and expressing emotions in various situations
- Using emotions: Using emotions as fuel and motivation for creative, adaptive thinking

People with high emotional intelligence often have other beneficial traits, such as the ability to delay gratification while pursuing long-term goals. Ex. Marshmallow test

### Measuring intelligence

- Binet’s mental age test (late 1800s): Binet developed tests to predict a child’s level of success in regular education. His goal is to determine which students would need support.
- Wechsler’s Tests (Intelligence PLUS): The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) measure “g”/IQ. These tests include Describing similarities and differences, Timed math problems, Vocabulary knowledge, Re-sequencing and recall of letters and numbers, and Arranging blocks to produce designs.

### Fluid and Crystallized Intelligence

- Fluid intelligence: the ability to think quickly and abstractly. This is the strongest in youth and decreases with age.
- Crystallized intelligence: accumulated wisdom, knowledge, expertise, vocabulary, and judgment. These stay strong into old age.
