## Abnormal Psychology (Psychological Disorders)

Psychological disorder, which is not common, experiences discomfort with oneself or others due to its behavior, and is considered to be a disorder when there is a small role in the individual's recognition of the person, i.e. a maladaptive behavior that prevents them from living their daily lives. Symptoms and actions result in diagnosis when pain is received. Pinel (1745-1826) proposed that mental disorders were not caused by demonic possession, but by stress and inhumane conditions. Pinel’s “moral treatment” involved improving the environment of the asylum and gentleness.

### The Medical Model

Psychological disorders can be seen as psychopathology, an illness of the mind. Disorders can be diagnosed, labeled as a collection of symptoms that tend to go together. People with disorders can be treated, attended to, given therapy, all with a goal of restoring mental health.

### Biopsychosocial Approach

Biopsychosocial approach research interaction between these three factors.

1. Biological influences: Evolution, individual genes, brain structure and chemistry
2. Psychological influences: Stress, trauma, mood-related perceptions and memories
3. Social-cultural influences:  Roles and expectations / definitions of normality and disorder vary

## Classifying psychological disorders

The Purpose is that describe a disorder, predict its course, imply appropriate treatment, stimulate research into causes. Main tool of diagnostic classification is Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5).

### Anxiety Disorders

Anxiety Disorders: Our self-protective, risk-reduction instincts in overdrive

- Generalized Anxiety Disorder
- Panic Disorder
- Phobias
- OCD
- PTSD

### General Anxiety Disorder (GAD)

Characterized by a global, persistent, chronic, excessive state of fear and anxiety in the absence of true danger. The identified source of apprehension constantly changes or cannot be identified. Emotional-cognitive symptoms include worrying, having anxious feelings and thoughts about many subjects. Physical symptoms include autonomic arousal, trembling, sweating, fidgeting, agitation, and sleep disruption.

### Panic Disorder

- Characterized by recurring (repeated and unexpected) panic attacks, as well as the constant worry of another panic attack
- many minutes of intense dread (feeling of being paralyzed with fright)
- chest pains, choking, numbness, or other frightening physical sensations.
- a feeling of a need to escape.

### Specific Phobia

A specific phobia is more than just a strong fear or dislike. A specific phobia is diagnosed when there is an uncontrollable, irrational, intense desire to avoid the some object or situation of phobia. Even an image of the object can trigger a reaction--“GET IT AWAY FROM ME!!!”

### Agoraphobia

Agoraphobia is the avoidance of situations or place in which they might be trapped or unable to receive help in emergency –fear having a panic attack.

### Social phobia (social anxiety disorder)

An intense fear of being watched and judged by others, often showing as a fear of possibly embarrassing public appearances.

### Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder [OCD]

- Obsessions are intense, unwanted worries, ideas, and images that repeatedly pop up in the mind.
- A compulsion is a repeatedly strong feeling of “needing” to carry out an action, even though it doesn’t feel like it makes sense.

It becomes disorder when you are deeply frustrated with not being able to control the behaviors, or when the time and mental energy spent on these thoughts and behaviors interfere with everyday life.

Common pattern: RECHECKING Although you know that you’ve already made sure the door is locked, you feel you must check again. And again.

### Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)

About 10 to 35 percent of people who experience trauma not only have burned-in memories, but also four weeks to a lifetime of:

- Repeated intrusive recall of those memories.
- Nightmares and other re-experiencing.
- Social withdrawal or phobic avoidance.
- Jumpy anxiety or hypervigilance.
- Insomnia or sleep problems.

### Bipolar Disorder

Bipolar disorder was once called “manic-depressive disorder.” Bipolar disorder’s two polar opposite moods are depression and mania (MOOD SWING).

### Mood Disorders

Major depressive disorder is: more than just feeling "down," and more than just feeling sad about something. It is counter-functional, chronic, and out of the range of social acceptance. Biological aspects, cognitive,  learned helplessness, depressive(pessimistic) explanatory style, and interpersonal socio-cultural are considered to explain mood disorder.

### Schizophrenia

Schizophrenia: the mind is split from reality (a split from one’s own thoughts so that they appear as hallucinations). Schizophrenia symptoms include:

- Disorganized and/or delusional thinking (Hallucination and delusionsProblem in thinking and speaking)
- Disturbed perceptions.
- Inappropriate emotions and actions.

In biological understanding, it is an brain-related disease. Too many dopamine help to explain hallucinations; it’s like taking amphetamine overdoses all the time. frontal lobes impairment judgment and self-control. Activation of the brain region during hallucinations as if real sensations were being received. There is general shrinking of many brain areas .

### Dissociative Disorders

Dissociation refers to a separation of conscious awareness from thoughts, memory, bodily sensations, feelings, or even from identity. Dissociation can serve as a psychological escape from an overwhelmingly stressful situation.

1. Dissociative Amnesia: Loss of memory with no known physical cause; inability to recall selected memories or any memories
2. Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID): Development of separate personalities. They have different brain wave patterns, different left-right handedness, and different visual acuity and eye muscle balance patterns.

### Antisocial Personality Disorder (APD)

- Personality disorder characterized by pattern of disregard for, or violation of, the right of others
- Lack of empathy, moral sense, guilt, and impulsive and aggressive behavior
- Inability to form meaningful interpersonal relationships
- Don’t think about consequences
- Prone to criminal behavior

Psychological factors:

1.  those who in preschool were impulsive, uninhibited, unconcerned with social rewards, and low in anxiety.
2. those who endured child abuse, and/or inconsistent, unavailable caretaking.

Biological APD Risk Factors:

- Some associated genes have been identified.
- Lower levels of stress hormones and low physiological arousal in stressful situations
- Fear conditioning is impaired.
- Substance dependence is more likely.

People who commit murder seem to have less tissue and activity in the part of the brain that suppresses impulses — less brain response when viewing violence and an overactive dopamine reward-seeking system.

### Eating Disorders

These may involve

- Unrealistic body image and extreme body ideal.
- A desire to control food and the body when one’s situation can’t be controlled.
- Cycles of depression.

||Definition|
|-|-|
|Anorexia Nervosa|Compulsion to lose weight, coupled with certainty about being fat despite being 15 percent or more underweight|
|Bulimia Nervosa|Compulsion to binge, eating large amounts fast, then purge by losing the food through vomiting, laxatives, and extreme exercise|
|Binge-Eating Disorder|Compulsion to binge, followed by guilt and depression|

Family factors:

- Having a mother focused on her weight, and on child’s appearance and weight
- Negative self-evaluation in the family
- For anorexia, if families are competitive, high-achieving, and protective ( Low self-evaluations/ high achievement standard)  

Cultural factors:

- Unrealistic ideals of body appearance

## Understanding Anxiety

1. Classical conditioning: overgeneralizing a conditioned response (associated)
2. Operant conditioning: rewarding avoidance (reinforced)
3. Observational
4. Cognitive perspective: Maladaptive, Negative, Biased cognitions
5. Biological Genes and brain: Medical model Active anxiety pathways
6. Psychoanalytic: Unconscious mind, Early childhood trauma
7. Vulnerability stress model: Interaction between genes and environment

### Classical Conditioning and Anxiety

- Watson’s, ‘Little Albert’ learned to fear a rabbit (rat) because he had been conditioned to associate them with a loud scary noise.
- Sometimes, such a conditioned response becomes over-generalized. We may begin to fear all animals, everything fluffy, all experimenters.
- The result is a phobia or generalized anxiety.

### Operant Conditioning and Anxiety

- We may feel anxious in a situation and make a decision to leave. This makes us feel better and our anxious avoidance was just reinforced (impact of reinforcement).
- If we know we have locked a door but feel anxious and compelled to re-check, rechecking will help us temporarily feel better.
- The result is an increase in anxious thoughts and behaviors-> OCD

### Observational Learning and Anxiety

- Experiments with humans and monkeys show that anxiety can be acquired through observational learning. If you see someone else avoiding or fearing some object or creature, you might pick up that fear and adopt it
- In this way, fears get passed down in families.

### Cognitive perspective and Anxiety

- Cognition includes worried thoughts, as well as interpretations, appraisals, beliefs, predictions, and ruminations.
- Individuals who suffer from mental disorders have distorted and irrational thinking

It is the way you think about the problem, rather than the problem itself which causes the mental disorder

### Biology and Anxiety

- Studies show that identical twins, even raised separately, develop similar phobias.
- Some people seem to have an inborn high strung temperament, while others are more easygoing (genes).
- Genes regulate levels of neurotransmitters.
- People with anxiety have problems with levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter involved in regulating sleep and mood (Low).

## Current Forms of Therapy

- Biomedical therapy: the use of medications acting directly on the body to reduce the symptoms of mental disorders
- Psychotherapy: an interactive experience with a trained professional, working on under standing and changing behavior, thinking, relationships, and emotions

We will cover various forms of psychotherapy.

- Psychoanalysis, Psychodynamic therapy: Unconscious-early childhood
- Humanistic, Client-centered therapy: Empathy and unconditional positive regard
- Behavior therapy: Using conditioning, learning
- Cognitive therapy: changing thoughts

### Behavior Therapy

The client might know the right changes to make, but finds that it’s hard to change actual behavior. Behavior therapy uses the principles of learning, especially classical and operant conditioning, to help reduce unwanted responses. Aversion Therapy (Aversive conditioning can associate the bad behavior with a negative response) and Exposure Therapy (Expose patients to things or situations they fear and avoid) is the example of Behavior Therapy.

### Cognitive therapy – belief system

Interpreting current events as signs of the worst possible outcome). For example: “Now that I’ve made a mistake in my lecture, I’ve failed as a professor. Students can’t take me seriously, and they can’t learn from me.” Being depressed and/or anxious involves negative thoughts and interpretations. In the cognitive perspective, the cause of depression are not bad events, but our thoughts about those events.

### Cognitive Behavioral Therapy

Cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT] target and change both thoughts and behaviors. Correct the patient’s faulty cognitions, AND Train to engage in new behaviors: OCD, anxiety, panic disorder.

### Psychoanalysis / Psychoanalytic

Sigmund Freud: searching for the ‘root’ of the problem

Techniques of Psychoanalysis:

- Free association: the patient speaks freely about memories, dreams, feelings (Repressed ideas)
- Interpretation

### Humanistic Therapies

Humanistic therapy support personal growth. “Client-centered therapy” is sthe Carl Rogers’s name for his style of humanistic therapy. There are three main components: Being genuine, Being unconditional positive regard, and Being empathetic. Therapist should be trustful and give real caring and respect for the patients. Active listening and showing empathy might cure the patients.
