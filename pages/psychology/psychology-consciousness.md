## Consciousness

Individual awareness of internal (bodily sensations and thoughts) and external (events in the environment) stimuli

### Thresholds

The absolute threshold refers to the minimum level of stimulus intensity needed to detect a stimulus half the time.

### Daily Rhythms

Daily rhythms vary from person to person and with age. General peaks are categorized into two types in alertness: evening peak—20-year old “knight owls” / morning peak—50-year old “early bird.” Daily rhythms have the 24 hour cycle, the following factors vary, rising and falling over the course of the day and night: body temperature, arousal/energy, mental sharpness.

### Sleep

Sleep is one of the most important factor in our life. Research shows that inadequate sleep can make you more likely to: lose brainpower, gain weight, get sick, be irritable, feel old.

Above picture describes two types of sleep pattern: REM (Rapid eye movement) sleep and non-REM sleep. In REM sleep, brain is active but the body is immobile (muscle movement is turned-off). So, it is also called Paradoxical sleep, There are four features in REM sleep: Heart rate rises and breathing becomes rapid, Brain metabolic rate almost comparable to wakefulness, Dreams occur, and Memory consolidation

### Sleep Disorders

These behaviors, mostly affect children, and occur in NONREM-3 sleep. They are not considered dreaming. Sleepwalking and sleeptalking run in families, so there is a possible genetic.

- Insomnia: Chronic difficulty to fall asleep or stay asleep
- Narcolepsy (“numb seizure”): sleep attacks, even a collapse into REM/paralyzed sleep, at inopportune times
- Sleep apnea (“with no breath”): repeated awakening after breathing stops; time in bed is not restorative sleep

### Psychoactive drugs

Psychoactive drugs are chemicals introduced into the body which alter perceptions, mood, and other elements of conscious experience. There are two factors related to addiction: tolerance and withdrawal.

There are three types of Psychoactive drugs.

- Depressant: Chemicals that reduce neural activity and other body functions : drugs that depress CNS. (ex:Alcohol, tranquillizer, opiates)
- Stimulants: Increases activity of CNS and the body; increases alertness and arousal (Caffeine, Nicotine to Amphetamines,Cocaine)
- Hallucinogen: Drugs that produce hallucinations and images that seem real though they are not. Changes in thoughts, emotion and consciousness (Marijuana)

These drugs expect three types of influences.

- Biological influences: genetic predispositions and variations in neurotransmitter systems
- Social-cultural influences: urban environment, cultural attitude toward drug use, and peer influences
- Psychological influences: lacking sense of purpose, significant stress, and psychological disorders such as depression
