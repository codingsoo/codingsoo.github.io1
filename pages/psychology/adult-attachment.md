## Adult Attachment

Tendency of an individual to make efforts to seek and mai ntain proximity and contact with specific individuals who provide physical/and psychological safety and security

## Attachment theory (Bowlby, 1969)

Child has a natural (inborn) need to attach to his or her caregiver (usually mother). They rely on attachment figures (mother) for protection, support, and help with emotion regulation. Failure to form this maternal attachment during early years (0-5 yrs) would lead to negative consequences, also for future relationships – internal working model- “cradle to the grave.”

### Secure attachment style

I find it relatively easy to get close to others and am comfort able depending on them and having them depend on me. I don’t worry about being abandoned or about someone getting too close to me (~55%, Hazan & Shaver, 1987).

- Values and enjoys relationships and tends to have long ones
- Grieves loss but achieves resolution
- Copes with stress by seeking support
- Support partner when partner is distressed (compassionate, responsive)
- Balance (independence/dependence)

### Avoidant/dismissing attachment pattern

I’m somewhat uncomfortable being close to others; I find it difficult to trust them completely, difficult to allow myself to depend on them. I’m nervous when anyone gets too close, and often, others want me to be more intimate that I feel comfortable (~25%, Hazan & Shaver, 1987).

- Avoid close relationships (lowest interest and commitment) High in independence
- Describes parents as rejecting and emotionally cool
- Expresses less grief following loss
- Withdraws from partner when partner is distressed
- Avoid conflict by distancing
- Doesn’t like to open up
- Low trust in others

### Anxious/preoccupied attachment pattern

I find that others are reluctant to get close as I would like. I often worry that my partner (boyfriend/girlfriend) doesn't really love me or won’t want to stay with me. I want to get very close to my partner, and this sometimes scares people away (~20%, Hazan & Shaver, 1987).

- Deeply invested in relationships, wants to get close quickly yet contributes to frequent break-ups
- Describes parents as intrusive; sometimes still angry at time
- Grieves intensely following break-ups or loss
- frequently jealous and afraid romantic partner will leave; seeking approval and reassurances
- Worries about rejection or disapproval during daily interactions
- Emotional high and low

### Some tips

- Be objective about your partner’s behavior as well as your own – know your pattern.
- Anxious: cultivate friendship and activity outside your relationship. Have confidence in your ability to make your partner feel valued through attention you pay.
- Avoidant: identify your “deactivating strategy” and your tendency towards negative view of others.
- Secure: Know your ability to have a secure relationship, thereby making avoidant/anxious individuals less so.
