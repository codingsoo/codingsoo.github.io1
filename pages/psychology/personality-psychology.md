## Personality Psychology

### Personality traits

Distinctive characteristic patterns of thoughts, emotion, and behavior that make up an individual

- What makes each individual unique
- Relatively consistent and enduring
- Predict behaviors (ex: “That is so typical of John”)

I will dig into the 5 Factor Model (THE BIG FIVE): Extroversion, Neuroticism, Conscientiousness, Agreeableness , and Openness.

### Extroversion

An orientation of one’s interests and energies toward the other world of people and thing rather than the inner world of subjective experience. Carl Jung introduces two types: Introvert (Attention is focused inward; people who prefer their internal world of thoughts) and Extrovert (Attention is directed outward; people who prefer the external world of things and activities).

|Low (Introversion)|High (Extroversion)|
|-|-|
|Quiet, Passive, Reserved, Inhibited, Solitary|Outgoing, Sociable, Enthusiastic, talkative, Active, Energetic, Assertive, Positive emotions, Excitement, Quick to form new relationship, Ambitious, lots of energy in the pursuit of goals Attention-seeking, and Excitement-seeking Tendency to seek stimulation (Joy, enthusiasm, desire, and excitement)|
|They are excellent listeners / They make great leaders / Strong at making thoughtful, considered decision|They are great at networking / Positive moods / Good at sharing emotions / Entertaining people-center of attention|

### Neuroticism

Tendency to experience unpleasant emotions easily, such as anger, anxiety, depression, or vulnerability

|Low|High|
|-|-|
|Calm, Hardy, Secure, emotionally stable|Sensitive, Nervous, Prone to stress and worry, emotional, self-conscious / Chronic elevation of stress hormones- poorer immune systems / Associated with depression and anxiety disorder :Detecting negative emotions|

### Conscientiousness

Tendency to be organized, responsible, and hardworking

|Low|High|
|-|-|
|Spontaneous, Careless, Impulsive Undependable, Negligent|Reliable, Organized, Selfdirected, Trusting / Predictor of occupational success|

- Low conscientiousness : spontaneously and energetically respond to immediate stimuli- Professional sports (Association of ADHD- and success in profession sports)
- Obsessive compulsive disorder in extremely high in conscientiousness: perfectionism, mental and interpersonal control, preoccupied with rules and schedules, The actual point of the activity (have a nice day, to bond, to enjoy the environment) is entirely lost

### Agreeableness

Tendency to act in a cooperative, unselfish manner

|Low|High|
|-|-|
|Critical, suspicious, uncooperative, Ruthless|Cooperative, Helpful, Empathetic , kind, Warm, Good-natured, Softhearted, Selfless|

- Cost to some measure of personal success: Agreeableness score was negative predictor of their income: the less agreeable the executive, the better they do.
- Need to be ruthless and put yourself and your progress first if you want to succeed in business
- Corporation and political parties: generally led by people with low agreeableness

### Openness

Openness to experience: Tendency to be open to new aesthetic, cultural, or intellectual experiences

|Low|High|
|-|-|
|Practical, Conventional, inartistic, lives in the now (avoids new thing)|Creative, imaginative, eccentric, original curious / Creative thinking and flexible attitude|

### The positive message!!!

- Any level of any BIG FIVE is advantageous in someway while being disadvantageous in others. No better or worse personality profile to have
- Knowing your personality is a strength: Not try to change your personality, but understand your personality, what your personality entails and use this information to make a wise choice about your career.

## Defense Mechanism

- Strategies for preventing or reducing anxiety
- It helps us over the rough spots until we can deal with stressful situation

### Rationalization

Jane failed her history course because she didn’t study or attend class, but she told her roommates that she failed because the professor didn’t like her.

### Regression

After failing to pass his examination, Kenny spends days in bed cuddling his favorite childhood toy.

### Repression

Jennifer can’t remember her grandfather’s heart attack, when she was pregnant.

### Reaction Formation

A politician gives anti-gay speeches, then turns out to have homosexual tendencies.

### Denial

Smokers refuse to admit to themselves that smoking is bad for their health.

### Projection

Angelina often cheats on her boyfriend because she suspects he is already cheating on her.

### Displacement

Someone who is frustrated by his boss at work may go home and kick the dog.
