## Developmental Psychology

The study of human development and the changes over a person’s life span

### Three issues in Developmental Psychology

- Nature and nurture: How can we distinguish between hereditary causes of behavior (genetic makeup that influence growth and development) and the environmental causes of behavior (the influence of parents, siblings, family, friends, schooling, nutrition, etc) ?
- Change and stability: In what ways do we change as we age, and in what ways do we stay the same?
- Continuity and stages: Is development a gradual change or are there some leaps to a new way of thinking or behaving?

### Fetal life and Dangers

- Teratogens (“monster makers”) are substances such as viruses and
chemicals that can damage the developing fetus.
- Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) refers to cognitive, behavioral, and body/brain structure abnormalities caused by exposure to alcohol in the fetal stage.

### Inborn reflexes and skills

Reflexes are responses that are inborn and do not have to be learned. Ex) Babinski reflex- baby’s toes fan out when sole of baby’s foot is stroked. Newborns have reflexes to ensure that they will be fed.

- The rooting reflex--when something touches a newborn’s cheek, the infant turns toward that side with an open mouth.
- The sucking reflex- prompts infants to suck at things that touch their lips

### Maturation and critical periods

- “Maturation” refers to changes that occur primarily because of the passage of time.
- Biologically driven growth and sequential changes in behavior
- Genetically programmed without any influence from the environment
- Maturation will be seen in brain development and motor development
- Critical periods: crucial periods in a person’s life for specific types of learning that shape the capacity for future development

There are two critical periods evidences. First case is a wild boy of Aveyron, France (Victor) found in 1800. He was 10 years old and preferred raw food and ripped any clothes that were put on him. He could not speak or understand human language. Even after 30 years of learning, he was not able to speak. Second case is a feral child ‘Genie’, 1970 in LA. It was a study of a young girl who was deprived of language in her early years (kept locked for 13 years until she was discovered). She was unable to learn language due to the fact that she had missed her critical period. This study is an unique opportunity to scientist: how brain works nature vs. nurture.

### Autism Spectrum Disorder and theory of mind

Children with disorders on the autism spectrum have difficulties in three general areas:
- Establishing mutual social interaction
- Using language and play symbolically
- Displaying flexibility with routines, interests, and behavior

Children with ASD have more difficulty than a typical child in mentally mirroring the thoughts and actions of others; this difficulty has been called “mind blindness.”

### Piaget’s 4 stages of life and their developmental phenomena

Cognitive Development: Jean Piaget (1896-1980)

1. Sensorimotor stage (0 ~ 2 yrs) Experiencing world though senses and actions (looking, hearing, touching, mouthing, and grasping)
    - Object Permanence 6 to 8months: Objects continue to exist even when they are not in sight. Ex: When the toy is hidden by a cloth, the infants acts as if the toy no longer exists) Through games like “peekaboo,” kids learn object permanence--the idea that objects exist even when they can’t be seen. Before Object Permanence: Out of sight, out of mind!
2. Preoperational (2-6yrs) (Pre-thought):
    - Egocentrism: Failure to see other people’s perspective. They believe that everyone else perceives the environment the same way they do. “I am the world”
    - Failure of Conservation: Understanding that the amount of a substance remains the same (is conserved) even when its form is changed
3. Concrete Operational Stage (7-11yrs)
    - Can think logically about objects and events -understand conservation, perform mathematical operations and transformations
    - can’t think abstractly
4. Formal Operational Stage (12+)
    - Children arrive at adult model of thinking
    - Can think abstractly and hypothetically/weighing several thoughts at once and understand each consequences (Solve problems)

### A critique of Piaget’s theory

Social and cultural context plays no role in Piaget’s theory (Piaget thought cognitive development is mostly universal across culture). Vygotsky and scaffolding provides the appropriate assistance will give the student enough of a boost to achieve the task! Social interaction is important!

### Kohlberg's theory of Moral Development

Lawrence Kohlberg was a cognitive psychologist who applied developmental psychology specifically to moral development. He identified three primary stages of moral development and two sub stages within each. The three primary stages are: pre-conventional moral thinking, conventional moral thinking, and post-conventional moral thinking. Let's say that there is a person, Heinz, whose wife is sick but has no money for buying drug.

1. Pre-conventional morality: Heinz should not steal the drug since he would be breaking the law
     - Stage 1 (Punishment): what is right and wrong is determined by what is punishable. Moral action = avoidance of punishment
     - Stage 2 (Personal usefulness): What is right and wrong is what brings rewards. Self-interest!
2. Conventional morality: Heinz should steal the drug and accept any prison sentence
    - Stage 3 (Conforming to the will of the group): Good boy/Nice girl-Determined by what pleases and is approved by others
    - Stage 4 (Law and order): Authority must be respected and the social rules must be maintained.
3. Post-conventional morality: Heinz should steal the drug and not go to prison as this is unfair
    - Stage 5 (Social contract and human rights): Individuals are viewed as holding different opinions and values. Although laws should be respected, individual rights can sometimes supersede these rules
    - Stage 6 (Ethical principle): Good and right are matters of individual conscience, concept of justice, human dignity and equality

### Social development

- Attachment: Strong emotional bond between caregiver(s) and infant during the first few years of life.

Attachment refers to an emotional tie to another person. In children, attachment can appear as a desire for physical closeness to a caregiver.

![harlow-monkey](https://wardballoon.github.io/images/harlow-monkey.png)

Experiments with monkeys suggest that attachment is based on physical affection and comfortable body contact, and not based on being rewarded with food. “A child’s failure to form a secure attachment to caregiver in the early years is related to an inability to develop close personal relationships in adulthood” (Bowlby, 1973). Most creatures tend to attach to caregivers who have become familiar. Birds have a critical period, hours after hatching, during which they might imprint: become rigidly attached to the first moving object they see.

### Attachment Variation: Styles of Dealing with Separation

Strange situations” test:

1. a mother and infant child are alone in an unfamiliar (“strange”) room; the child explores the room.
2. the mother leaves the room.
3. After a few moments, the mother returns.

- Secure attachment: mild distress when mother leaves, seeking contact with her when she returns
- Insecure attachment not exploring, clinging to mother, loudly upset when mother leaves, remaining upset when she returns OR seeming indifferent to mother’s departure and return

What causes these different attachment styles: nature or nurture? In nature perspective, temperament refers to a person’s characteristic style and intensity of emotional reactivity. Some infants seem to be “difficult”; they are irritable,
with unpredictable needs and behavior, and intense reactions. Some infants have an “easy” temperament happy, relaxed, and calm, with predictable rhythms of hunger and sleep. Otherwise, in nurture perspective, sensitive, responsive, calm parenting is correlated with the secure attachment style.

### Emerging Adulthood (Age 18-30)

Emerging adulthood comes between adolescence and adulthood. People in emerging adulthood Feel in between, not adolescence, but not so ready to assume financially independence and responsibilities yet associated with adulthood. They try to find out "who I am" and a soul mate. They are also trying to find a place in the world in love and work.
