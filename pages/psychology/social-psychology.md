## Social Psychology

Scientific study of the ways that people’s behavior and mental processes are shaped by the presence of others. How people function in groups? In other words, this study is about the power of situation. Personality Psychologists could study the traits that might make one person more likely than another to speak, and Social Psychologists might examine aspects of the classroom situation that would influence any student’s decision about speaking.

### Conformity

People tend to agree with a group. We are influenced by others because we want to fit in by behaving in ways that are acceptable to them. Sherif’s light study (1935) is famous for Conformity. During the first session, each participant was alone in the dark room when making their judgments. However, during the next three session, they were in the room with two other participants, and could hear each others’ estimates. Then, individual estimates converged on group norm. [Asch’s Classic line experiment (1955)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments) is also famous.

### Conformity to institutional norm

How does group influence individual behavior? The famous “Stanford Prison Experiment” by social psychologist Zimbardo (1973) showed situation alone seems to have transformed not only their perceptions and behavior but also aspects of their characters. 24 healthy and “normal” (having no history of psychological problems) students participated for the study. Half of these students were randomly assigned to be guards and half to be prisoners. Remarkably, prisoners became passive, depressed. Guards became brutal, exploring the limits of their power. Zimbardo was shocked at how quickly deeply guards became brutal. Study ended in only 6 days.

### Milgram’s obedience study

After WWII, Nazis were put on trial for slaughtering innocent Jews in concentration camps. Many said that they should not be punished for their crimes because they were merely following orders. Many said they had no choice but to do what they were told. “I was just following the order.” Milgram wanted to study the influence of direct commands on behavior.

In surveys, most people predict that in such a situation they would stop administering shocks when the “learner” expressed pain. However, in reality, even when the learner complained of a heart condition, most people complied with the experimenter’s directions.
