## What brought me to start this bog?

### Organizing Studies

I started blogging because I wanted to organize my studies. It's also good to organize personal notes or books, but I wanted to share with more people what I've learned on the Internet with great accessibility. In this process, I can have time to make sure what I know is correct or not. Moreover, I can attach a lot of material online and easily add images and videos.

### Self-Branding

I've seen a lot of people get in touch with me when I put my project online. If I put them in one place and promote them more actively, I think there will be more opportunities for me. Personal blogs seem to be an effective way to get other people to know me.

### Improving Writing Skills

It is often difficult to write in English because I was not born in an English-speaking country. I want to improve my English writing skills by making a habit of writing in English. I will correct wrong expressions by getting an English teacher and periodically showing the blog posts.

## How this blog will run?

This blog is a tech website which has four main categories.

### Main Page

This is the main page that you can enter by clicking the Home icon in the upper left corner. It's a space where I've listed information about myself.

### News

In this section, I will scrap various IT-related issues, papers, etc. Since I am interested in various fields of computer science, I am planning to post IT knowledge comprehensively. At least one post will be posted a week, and if you visit my blog at any time, you'll be able to get some useful and exciting updates.

### Study

I will organize my studies in a way that makes it easier for others to see.

### Projects

Among the projects I've worked on, I'm going to post good projects with description and annotation.
