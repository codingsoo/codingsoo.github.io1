## What brought me to start this blog?

### Organizing studies

I start blogging because I wanted to organize my studies. It's also good to organize personal notes or books, but I wanted to share with more people what I've learned on the Internet with great accessibility. In this process, I can check what I know is correct or not. Moreover, I can easily attach a lot of great materials such as images and videos.

### Self branding

I have portfolio in this blog. 

### Improving writing skills

It is difficult to write in English for me. I want to improve my writing skill by making a habit of writing in English.

## Blog category description

This blog is a tech website which has four main categories.

### Main page

It is my portfolio page.

### News

In this section, I will scrap various IT-related issues, papers, etc. Since I am interested in various fields of computer science, I am planning to post IT knowledge comprehensively. I will post an article once a week. So, if you visit my blog at any time, you'll be able to get useful and exciting information.

### Study

I will post studying materials or make lecture documents.

### Projects

Among the projects I've worked on, I'm going to post good projects with description and annotation.
