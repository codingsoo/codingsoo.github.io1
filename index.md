## Blog Introduction

This blog is a tech website which has three main categories. If you have any questions, welcome to any email! Email information is at the bottom.

### 1. News

In this section, I will scrap various IT-related issues, papers, etc. Since I am interested in various fields of computer science, I am planning to post IT knowledge comprehensively. At least one post will be posted a week, and if you visit my blog at any time, you'll be able to get some useful and exciting updates.

### 2. Study

I will organize my studies in a way that makes it easier for others to see.
